## Results

- [S&P 500 Prediction](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1O7T_utXXIbUCJwC5gXD6rqxihh1PfzD5?usp=sharing) 

## Overview
This Program aims to predict stock prices using various machine learning models, namely Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Radial Basis Function (RBF) Regression. The code fetches historical stock data for companies in the S&P 500 index, calculates daily returns, and trains different regression models for stock price prediction.


## Libraries Used

- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- yfinance: Fetching historical stock data
- numpy: Numerical operations
- matplotlib: Plotting graphs
- sklearn: Machine learning models and tools
- datetime: Working with dates and times
- joblib: Parallel processing for model training


## Skills Demonstrated

- Developed a Python script for predicting stock prices, employing various machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Radial Basis Function (RBF) Regression.

- Utilized web scraping to extract the list of S&P 500 companies from Wikipedia and fetched historical stock data using the yfinance library.

- Applied data manipulation techniques with the pandas library to handle and process stock data efficiently.

- Performed feature engineering by calculating daily returns, which served as a key feature for training the machine learning models.

- Implemented machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, RBF Regression, and Evaluated model performance using the root mean squared error (RMSE) as a metric.

- Employed Matplotlib for creating visualizations that compare actual stock prices with predictions for each machine learning model.

- Implemented parallel processing using the joblib library during model training for improved efficiency.
